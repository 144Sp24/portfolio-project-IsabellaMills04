            <p><span class="action">Hello!</span> I'm Isabella Mills. I'm currently a freshman at Northwest Missouri State University studying Digital Media with an emphasis in Computer Science!</p>
            <p>People often describe me as a very creative person. For as long as I can remember, I've loved art, designing things, and anything that gets the creative gears going! </p>
            <p class="tablet-desktop">All throughout my high school career, I took various art classes to enhance my skills so that my senior year, I'd be able to take an Advanced Placement art course. Additonally, my senior year I decided to join my school's yearbook as a photographer. My mother has had a digital camera for years that I've always loved tinkering with, so with the knowledge of art principles and camera mechanics, I was able to produce quality photos for the yearbook.</p>
            <p class="action tablet-desktop">Enough about art and photography. Here are some random facts about me because why not!</p>
